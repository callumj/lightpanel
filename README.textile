h1. Lightpanel

lightpanel is a server and client project for controlling a custom build LED panel.

The server is written in Java and does the basic and boring tasks of receiving instructions over a socket to switch on a specific LED at row+col or an exact index.

The client is written in Ruby for running strobes, fades and scrolling on the LED panel.
